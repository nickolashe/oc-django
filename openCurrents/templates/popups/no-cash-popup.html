  <p>You will need Available Dollars to cash out to your bank
    account or donate to a nonprofit of your choice. If you have redeemed an
    offer and have pending dollars in your account, you'll need to wait until
    the business verifies your proof of purchase at the end of the month.</p>
  <p>To see offers from businesses in the community, please visit the
